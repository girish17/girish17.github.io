		<h2>Blissful being</h2>
		<p>It's nauseating to keep going. Feels like we're just trying our best to keep a happy face with contentment which is far out.</p>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<p>Sleeping in the same misery that engulfed from the very beginning. I wish this keyboard were a piano and composing a sonnet was an interplay of finger's rhythmic movement synchronized with a flow. A flow of energy from within.</p>
		<br/>

		<p>Working seems like pulling a band-aid off a painful wound. They created a term called 'work' which sounds more like effort and less like pleasure. Such a simple four letter word to mean so much effor and pain. Why is effort despised? When someone works 'hard', they maybe seen as a 'mule'. It means a tedious repetition, which in no way can be simulating or different. Just another endless chore which toils them to the bones. Crushing under the force of strong current of expectations and ricocheted by the sharp and mighty distractions.</p>
